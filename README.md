# ar-js-test
This repository is a succesfull tryout of the implementation of ar.js library with loading in custom glb-files.

To test for yourself:
1. Clone the git repo
2. Locate to ar.js > at line 26 and change lat & lon to a loc close to you
3. run "npm run dev" in terminal to run the localhost and go at it

I made this little repo public beause I was struggeling with it myself quite a lot and couldn't really find nice examples online.

Hope this helps people who need it :)
